          "Question": "What is unique about FAB? What problem does it solves?",
          "Answer": {
            "Section1": "Scalability is one of the major bottlenecks in public blockchain platforms. While Bitcoin, Ethereum and similar systems have been successful as cryptocurrencies, the transactional capacities are severely limited on most of the blockchain platforms that are available. For the most part they are only capable of processing a few transactions per second while the most popular platforms are able to handle no more than seven transactions per second.<br/>There seems to be an ever increasing demand in the enterprise sector to use Blockchains for the underlying processing of business applications. This makes the quest for a solution to the transactional performance issues critical, while still maintaining the benefits gained from using blockchain platforms.<br/>FAB is a complete solution for constructing a practical public blockchain eco-system with high scalability, effective security, reliability, decentralization and the flexibility to develop multiple application types. It will allow for up to 1 million transactions per second.<br/>FAB is based upon a dedicated underlying protocolized framework design, middle layer smart contract enforcement, and an upper layer functional architecture implementation. It will allow blockchain technologies to succeed in real commercial use cases."

        },
        "Question7": {
          "Question": "Why is FAB a good choice compared to BTC+Lightening Network(LN) or Ethereum+Plasma in a nutshell",
          "Answer": {
            "Section1": "FAB gives users the ability to use their online assets across a wide range of different transaction platforms.<br/>To completely understand the differences, we need to understand LN and Plasma's theories. To simplify: for Lightening Network a user needs to deposit some Bitcoin to his LN wallet, hold some bitcoin there, set up a channel with the other party and do transactions. There can be many transactions in the channel before clearance to bitcoin blockchain, at the final, it is only counted as one transaction to reduce main blockchain transaction volume, that make sense.<br/>Here’s an example: Let's say, eBay is a LN, Amazon is another LN: To complete transactions on either platform, the user would need different LN wallets, and hold bitcoin in both. To transfer funds from the eBay LN to the Amazon LN, it will take an extra step through a central system. This creates a centralization issue and a two step reconciliation process.The best solution for wide use LN is all vendors and users use the same LNo a centralized system.<br/>FAB is here to solve the problem. A user can use his FAB coin wallet everywhere, , no coin holding needed, no centralization.<br/>In another aspect with both Bitcoin + Lightning Network or Ethereum + Plasma their main purpose is focusing on currency transaction. Our FAB network is built ground up from protocols designed to support upper layer management frameworks to provide simple and productive interfaces for value, trust, evidence, organization management. It is not only for currency. FAB also serves full business logic and any other data that requires decentralization and sharing features."

          "Question": "How long will it take after to build FAB to completion?",
          "Answer": {
            "Section1": "The foundation blockchain mainnet was released in March. We have a functional network, users trading coin, miners verifying transactions and developers building applications already. We are in the process of completing the middleware frameworks, annex chains and application layer to give the network full functionality. The entire project will be finished towards the end of 2018.

          "Question": "Who is the founder? How did they come up with the technical theory for FAB?",
          "Answer": {
            "Section1": "Paul Liu, the founder, is an experienced IT expert with over 20 years experience in developing financial, supply-chain applications. He was the first general manager of China Unionpay Financial Network where he led and developed a series of large scale applications.<br/>In 2014, we began to research and develop a decentralized supply chain system to increase business performance as the root objective. During our intensive research process, we came to the conclusion that current blockchain networks cannot handle enterprise level applications or their transactional needs due to the scalability problem inherent in their design structure.To overcome this issue fundamental issue, the team started to develop the foundation of our blockchain with a scalability solution in mind.<br/>After three years of research and development, the FAB project was launched. Our three-in-one design scheme combines a Foundation Blockchain, Auxiliary Blockchain, and Open Storage Architecture to create the FAB system. This three-in-one design allows the constraints of each individual part of the network to be conquered, solving the scalable bottleneck and allowing ease of development. With innovations such as KanBan, SCAR and CCUA, FAB is a network built from the ground up in its structure to be fully integrated into enterprise level operations.<br/>The development goal of the FAB Foundation is to use the FAB blockchain to promote scientific and technological progress, economic growth, and strive to build a fair and trusting world."
